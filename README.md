![hbnb](./images/hbtn.png)

## Description :house:

AirBnb is a complete web application, integrating database storage,
a back-end API, and front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB.

The project currently only implements the back-end console.

## About

This is the First Project towards our AirBnB clone project at [ALX](alxafrica.com). Done by [Mohamed](https://github.com/Mohamed-Mostafaaa) and [Eman](https://github.com/emanelkamel)

This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration
